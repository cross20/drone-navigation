# drone-navigation
Designed for Parrot Mambo Drones

drone-navigation is a program designed to demonstrate basic genetic algorithm functions. The code generates five random characters and then uses these characters to fly the drone. Over time, the drone will demonstrate better flight paths as it uses information on flight time combined with string mutation principles to produce better flight paths.

# using the code
How to use the code

start by visiting the installation guide for pyparrot, an external library used to conrol the drone, to see what needs to be done before using this code. The guide can be found here https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/wiki.

Once the code is downloaded, change the mambo address to the correct number (found on the drone) and run the file 'demodrone.py'

# issues
There are some known issues with the program

the code will not work unless the file 'mamboTimes.txt' has the value zero in place of whatever time is found inside.

# pyparrot
Python interface for Parrot Drones

pyparrot is designed to program Parrot Mambo and Parrot Bebop 2 drones using python.  This interface was developed to teach kids (K-12) STEM concepts (programming, math, and more) by having them program a drone to fly autonomously.  Anyone can use it who is interested in autonomous drone programming!
